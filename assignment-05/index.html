    <i>Daily Affirmations</i> is a book for parents to read to their children to teach them how to speak kind, positive, words to themselves. The goal of this book is that when kids learn to speak kindly to themselves they will have more confidence in themselves and accomplishments.

  <p>
    Melody and Laura plan to make this book into a three book series. The other books in the series will be called <i>Speaking Kindly To Others</i> and <i>Random Acts Of Kindness</i>.
