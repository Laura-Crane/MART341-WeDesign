    About Laura Schoening's Chicken Casserole
  </h1>

  <h2>
    This chicken casserole was Laura's grandmother's chicken casserole recipe. She used to call it a <em>poor man's casserole</em> because all of the ingredients are so cheap. This recipe was always a favorite of the families, so when Laura had kids of her own she began making it when they had leftover chicken to use. This casserole is easy for a night when you don't have much time and still want something delicous!
