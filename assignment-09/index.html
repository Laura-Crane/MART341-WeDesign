      How to Pick the Different Elements for Intention Candles
    </h1>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
      First you will want to start by deciding the purpose of your candle and what intentions you would like to set.
    </h1>

    <div>
      <h2>
        Herbs
      </h2>
    </div>

    <div style="margin:auto; padding:10px;">
      <span style="padding:50px;">
        <ul>
          <li>Look through a book that contains benefits and uses of different herbs.</li>
          <li>Once you feel like you have narrowed your search look up the herbs online to find any additional information you would like (ex. the history of the herbs).</li>
          <li>This is also a great way to find what essential oils you would like to use in your candle.</li>
          <li>When you feel like you have enough knowledge about the herbs and their purpose, go to the store or your garden to pick them out!</li>
        </ul>

    <div>
      <h2>
        Crystals
      </h2>
    </div>

    <div style="margin:auto; padding:10px;">
      <span style="padding:50px;">
        <ul>
          <li>Once again look through a book for crystals that serve the purpose of your candle.</li>
          <li>Once you feel like you have narrowed your search look up the crystals online to find any additional information or see what they look like so you can properly find them.</li>
          <li>Go to a crystal shop and talk with someone that works there!</li>
          <li>When deciding on a crystal think of the size of your container and the aesthetic of the herbs.</li>
          <li>The last step is making sure that whichever crystal you choose resignates with your intentions</li>
        </ul>

    <div>
      <h2>
        Decorating
      </h2>
    </div>

    <div style="margin:auto; padding:10px;">
      <span style="padding:50px;">
        <p>
          When your candle has almost finished cooling place the elements on top.  This portion could take some time to perfect.
          Placing the crystal on top before it's cooled enough will cause the crystal to sink. Placing the herbs on when the candle has cooled to much will not allow them to stick.
