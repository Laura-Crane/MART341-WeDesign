        <ul>
          <li>Look through a book that contains benefits and uses of different herbs.</li>
          <li>Once you feel like you have narrowed your search look up the herbs online to find any additional information you would like (ex. the history of the herbs).</li>
          <li>This is also a great way to find what essential oils you would like to use in your candle.</li>
          <li>When you feel like you have enough knowledge about the herbs and their purpose, go to the store or your garden to pick them out!</li>

          <li>Go to a crystal shop and talk with someone that works there!</li>
          <li>When deciding on a crystal think of the size of your container and the aesthetic of the herbs.</li>
          <li>The last step is making sure that whichever crystal you choose resignates with your intentions</li>

        <p>
          When your candle has almost finished cooling place the elements on top.  This portion could take some time to perfect.
          Placing the crystal on top before it's cooled enough will cause the crystal to sink. Placing the herbs on when the candle has cooled to much will not allow them to stick.
