# Assignment 14

### How did your user testing sessions go?
#### My user testing went well, I wish I would have gotten more feedback that I could do. It seemed like it was mostly everything looks good! Until I said don't hurt my feelings and then it was like when a carousel of photos might be cool! (I don't know how to do that though!)

### What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
#### I fixed my contact page and added a bigger box for comments. I also changed a lot of stuff after I did my user testing that I thought might make the page easier to navigate or more aesthetically pleasing
