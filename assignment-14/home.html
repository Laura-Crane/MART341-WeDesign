      <h2>
        The History of Candle Making
      </h2>
      <p>
        Candles are believed to have first been used by the Ancient Egyptians, but their candles never had wicks!
        They were made from soacking their torches in animal fat.
        The first candles to have wicks are credited to the ancient Romans.
        Isn't it wild that we now use candles for their aesthetic but they originated for the purpose of bringing light?!
